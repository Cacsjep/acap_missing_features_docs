## Info

Missing Feature ACAP requires a valid license to enable its featuresâ€”without a license, a feature cannot be configured or started. This licensing mechanism ensures that every deployment is properly authorized and that only approved functionalities are activated.

### Use License

If you have purchased a license, first register it through the [AXIS License Registration](https://www.axis.com/support/license-key-registration) portal. Then, open the camera web UI, navigate to the **Apps** section, and activate Missing Features ACAP.

### Requesting a Trial License

For testing and evaluation purposes, demo licenses can be requested by sending an email to [VideoSolutions@commend.at](mailto:VideoSolutions@commend.at) if the trial licenses have expired or their usage limits have been exceeded.
