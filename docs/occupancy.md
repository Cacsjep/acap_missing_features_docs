    The first created zone is non-deletable because it is bound to the camera where the ACAP is installed.

##### Configure Zone

###### **Zone Details**

- **Zone Name**  
  Enter or modify the name of the zone. This name should uniquely identify the area being monitored.

- **Add Camera**

- **Use Loitering Alert**  
  Enable to trigger an alert if no exit occurs after an entry within a defined time window.  
  - **Loitering Timeout (seconds):** The time in seconds after which the loitering alert is triggered if no exit event is received.

- **Use Thresholds**  
  Enable to define warning and maximum occupancy levels that can trigger additional actions.  
  - **Warn Level:** The occupancy count at which a warning should be triggered.
