# Features

Below is an overview of the features provided by Missing Feature ACAP. 

---

#### Flow
Design automation visually by dragging nodes onto a canvas and wiring them together. Includes Axis device nodes, HTTP/JSON utilities, Lua scripting, device management (per-device credentials, snapshots/resolutions reused across nodes), and type-safe wiring with per-node help.

#### License Plate List
License plate handling for working with plates with Flow.

#### Scene Analysis Triggers
Create event triggers based on metadata analysis.

#### Image to SD Card
Automatically saves an image whenever a specified event occurs (for example, during motion detection). You can configure both the retention period and the maximum storage capacity (in GB) to suit your requirements. With built-in video generation, snapshots can be transformed into a timelapse sequence—ideal for long-term observation and quick playback of key events.

#### Parking Times
Logs the in and out timestamps of vehicles identified by the AXIS License Plate Verifier. This feature maintains a detailed record of parking durations and triggers an event if a vehicle exceeds the designated time. It enables timely notifications, enforcement actions, or other workflow automations.

#### SD Explorer 
This feature explores the SD card contents.
